1. About this software
    This package includes the following two software programs to use with an EPSON TM series printer.

    1) Windows Printer Driver
        This driver is a Windows Printer Driver for the TM printer.
        This driver makes it possible to print from a Windows application.

    2) StatusAPI
        StatusAPI is a program that works in conjunction with the TM printer driver.
        It offers an Application Program Interface for obtaining the printer status 
        whether or not the printer is printing.  This API makes integrating printer
        status handling functions with applications more simple.

        For detailed information, please see each reference manual.

    3) OS
        The driver operation has been verified with the following operating systems. 

        Windows 11 64bit
        Windows 10 32/64bit
        Windows 8.1 32/64bit
        Windows 7 SP1 32/64bit
        Windows Server 2022 64bit

        A warning message may be displayed when installing the driver on Windows 7 or Windows XP.
        * There are no restrictions in the environment where the latest security update is implemented in Windows 7.
        * APD cannot be installed in the environment where KB2868626 security update program is not executed on Windows XP

        This driver is not supported by Windows 95/98/NT/2000 and Windows XP 64bit.

    4) Supported Printers
        EPSON TM-T20II

        The printer driver operates regardless of the pritner firmware version.


2. Supplied Files
    - APD_513_T20II_EWM.zip  : Printer Driver, StatusAPI installer with manuals

    Refer to the installation manual APD5_Install_en_revG.pdf.


3. Remarks
    1) For detailed information, please read each manual that is created by the installation
       APD5_MAN_T20II_EN_F.exe.

    2) When an error message is displayed during installation, the following procedure may enable to
       recover from the error.
       1) Specify the uninstall option, and execute the installer "APD_513_T20II.exe /uninstall".
       2) Remove the error factor.
       3) Execute the installer "APD_513_T20II.exe".

    3) In the Easy Print environment of Windows Server 2008, you cannot print the printer device font
       directly.
       However, you can print the device font converted from the True Type font by using
       "Font Substitution" of APD.
       For more information, see "Character Printing (Device Font)" in Printer Manual.

    4) When using Terminal Service and Remote Desktop, interactive communication becomes unavailable
       between the PC and the printer, prohibiting displaying the printer status and obtaining printer
       information using the Status API.

    5) The port redirection function is unavailable for a client when using Terminal Service or
       Remote Desktop.

    6) At times, the status of the shared printer may not be displayed correctly or the Status API may not
       be opened.
       These problems arise from the security policy settings of the operating system.
       Although changing the settings of the operating system is possible by the following steps, it lowers
       the security policy.
       (1) Go to [Start] - [Administrative tool] - [Local Security Policy].
       (2) [Security Option] - [Network Access (Set "Limit anonymous sccesses to the named pipe and shared
           printer" to "Invalid".)]
       However, you do not have to change the settings when a client PC is connected to the domain
       environment and when the same user name as a user name that is logged on a client is existing."

    7) Please use the same version of EPSON Advanced Printer Driver for each host when a network printer
       is shared among two or more hosts.
